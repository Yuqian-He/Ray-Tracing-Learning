# Introduction
This repository serves as a personal record of my learning journey. My goal for mastering the content of these three books spans one year, starting from May 1st, 2024, until the same date next year. It also functions as a traceable archive for my future reference. I will continually update my notes and document everything I learn from these books as well as other resources.
